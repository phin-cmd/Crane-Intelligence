## 📊 Bulk Processing Logic Updates

### Real CSV File Parsing
✅ **File Reading:** Uses FileReader API to read actual CSV files
✅ **Robust Parsing:** Handles various CSV formats with proper line splitting
✅ **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles malformed data
✅ **Progress Tracking:** Shows real-time processing status

### Calculation Consistency
All calculations now use the **SAME LOGIC** as single valuation:

#### Base Value Calculation
```javascript
baseCapacityValue = capacity * 5000
```

#### Age Depreciation
```javascript
ageAdjustment = baseValue * (age * 0.05) // 5% per year
```

#### Hours Adjustment
```javascript
expectedHours = age * 1500 // 1500 hours/year average
excessHours = actualHours - expectedHours
hoursAdjustment = excessHours > 0 ? (baseValue * 0.03) : 0
```

#### Regional Factors
```javascript
Regional Adjustments:
- North America: +4%
- Europe: +2%
- Asia Pacific: -2%
- Middle East: +1%
- Africa: -5%
- South America: -3%
```

#### Boom Length Adjustment (NEW)
```javascript
Baseline: 40 meters
Above baseline: +2% per 10m
Below baseline: -1.5% per 10m
```

### Dynamic Metrics Per Crane
Each crane gets calculated using the same helper functions:

1. **Confidence Score** (65-98%)
   - `calculateConfidenceScore(age, hours, capacity, region)`
   - Factors: Age, hours, capacity range, regional data availability

2. **Risk Score** (20-95)
   - `calculateRiskScore(age, hours, region, capacity)`
   - Components: Age risk + Hours risk + Regional risk + Market risk

3. **Deal Grade** (A+ to C)
   - `calculateDealGrade(confidenceScore, riskScore)`
   - Based on combined score: confidenceScore - riskScore
